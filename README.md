### Project date
------------------
- 20 September 2023


### Tech Stack
------------------
- Terraform
- Amazon VPC
- NAT gateways

### Overview
-----------------
This is the github repository that hosts the AWS CLI commands and Terraform Resource Blocks that are used in the video demo,  step-by-step guide, to creating and deploying a VPC, including public and private subnets, public route tables, and NAT gateways in AWS using Terraform Modules.

This demo covers everything from start to finish. You will learn how to set up your Terraform project structure in VS Code, configure an AWS CLI Profile for Terraform, configure an S3 and DynamoDB backend for remote state management, create a Reusable VPC and Nat Gateway Module, define Terraform variables, and configure the main deployment.

All of this will be done from scratch in Visual Studio Code, giving you a hands-on experience in writing and managing Terraform code. In the final steps, you will initialize Terraform, deploy the VPC, and  NAT Gateway module, and when finished destroy the resources gracefully using theTerraform destroy command.

This structured approach ensures you will have a complete understanding of the process from beginning to end.
